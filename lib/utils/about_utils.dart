      'I\'m a self-taught front-end developer, and a second-year Software Engineering student. I have learned about front-end web development using React.js, and back-end using Express.js. I then switched to cross-platform app development using Flutter, and I\'ve been working with Flutter until now. I haven\'t worked for a company or a start-up, but I\'ve built some cool personal projects that you might find interesting, and you can find those in the "Projects" section. I\'m currently working on other personal projects, some of which I intend to sell, and others I intend to release to the app stores.';
